=head1 NAME

ToolSet - Load your commonly-used modules in a single import

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.99.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Creating a ToolSet:

     # My/Tools.pm
     package My::Tools;
 
     use base 'ToolSet'; 
 
     ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );
     ToolSet->use_pragma( 'warnings' );
     ToolSet->use_pragma( qw/feature say switch/ ); # perl 5.10
 
     # define exports from other modules
     ToolSet->export(
         'Carp'          => undef,       # get the defaults
         'Scalar::Util'  => 'refaddr',   # or a specific list
     );
 
     # define exports from this module
     our @EXPORT = qw( shout );
     sub shout { print uc shift };
 
     1; # modules must return true

Using a ToolSet:

     # my_script.pl
 
     use My::Tools;
 
     # strict is on
     # warnings are on
     # Carp and refaddr are imported
 
     carp "We can carp!";
     print refaddr [];
     shout "We can shout, too!";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ToolSet provides a mechanism for creating logical bundles of modules that can
be treated as a single, reusable toolset that is imported as one.  Unlike
CPAN bundles, which specify modules to be installed together, a toolset
specifies modules to be imported together into other code.  

ToolSet is designed to be a superclass -- subclasses will specify specific
modules to bundle.  ToolSet supports custom import lists for each included
module and even supports compile-time pragmas like C<<< strict >>>, C<<< warnings >>>
and C<<< feature >>>. 

A ToolSet module does not physically bundle the component modules, but rather
specifies lists of modules to be used together and import specifications for
each.  By adding the component modules to a prerequisites list in a
C<<< Makefile.PL >>> or C<<< Build.PL >>> for a ToolSet subclass, an entire dependency chain
can be managed as a single unit across scripts or distributions that use the
subclass.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 Setting up

     use base 'ToolSet';

ToolSet must be used as a base class.

=head2 C<<< @EXPORT >>>

     our @EXPORT = qw( shout };
     sub shout { print uc shift }

Functions defined in the ToolSet subclass can be automatically exported during
C<<< use() >>> by listing them in an C<<< @EXPORT >>> array.

=head2 C<<< export >>>

     ToolSet->export(
         'Carp' => undef,                    
         'Scalar::Util' => 'refaddr',
     );

Specifies packages and arguments to import via C<<< use() >>>.  An argument of C<<< undef >>>
or the empty string calls C<<< use() >>> with default imports.  Arguments should be
provided either as a whitespace delimited string or in an anonymous array.  An
empty anonymous array will be treated like passing the empty list as an
argument to C<<< use() >>>.  Here are examples of how how specifications will be
provided to C<<< use() >>>:

     'Carp' => undef                 # use Carp; 
     'Carp' => q{}                   # use Carp;
     'Carp' => 'carp croak'          # use Carp qw( carp croak );
     'Carp' => [ '!carp', 'croak' ]  # use Carp qw( !carp croak );
     'Carp' => []                    # use Carp (); 

Elements in an array are passed to C<<< use() >>> as a white-space separated list, so
elements may not themselves contain spaces or unexpected results will occur.

=head2 C<<< use_pragma >>>

   ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );         # use strict;
   ToolSet->use_pragma( 'feature', ':5.10' ); # use feature ':5.10';

Specifies a compile-time pragma to enable and optional arguments to that
pragma.  This must only be used with pragmas that act via the magic C<<< $^H >>> or
C<<< %^H >>> variables.  It must not be used with modules that have other side-effects
during import() such as exporting functions.

=head2 C<<< no_pragma >>>

   ToolSet->no_pragma( 'indirect' ); # no indirect;

Like C<<< use_pragma >>>, but disables a pragma instead.

If a pragma is specified in both a C<<< use_pragma >>> and C<<< no_pragma >>> statement, the
C<<< use_pragma >>> will be executed first.  This allow turning on a pragma with 
default settings and then disabling some of them.

   ToolSet->use_pragma( 'strict' );
   ToolSet->no_pragma ( 'strict', 'refs' ); 

=head2 C<<< set_feature >>> (DEPRECATED)

B<See C<<< use_pragma >>> instead>

   ToolSet->set_feature( ":5.10" );
   ToolSet->set_feature( qw/say switch/ );

For Perl 5.10 or later, enables newer language features in modules the C<<< use() >>> 
this one.

=head2 C<<< set_strict >>> (DEPRECATED)

B<See C<<< use_pragma >>> instead>

   ToolSet->set_strict(1);
   ToolSet->set_strict(0); # default

Determines whether strict will enabled for modules that C<<< use() >>> this one.

=head2 C<<< set_warnings >>> (DEPRECATED)

B<See C<<< use_pragma >>> instead>

   ToolSet->set_warnings(1);
   ToolSet->set_warnings(0); # default

Determines whether warnings will enabled for modules that C<<< use() >>> this one.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

ToolSet will report an error for a module that cannot be found just like an
ordinary call to C<<< use() >>> or C<<< require() >>>.

Additional error messages include:

=over

=item *

C<<< "Invalid import specification for MODULE" >>> -- an incorrect type was
provided for the list to be imported (e.g. a hash reference)

=back

=over

=item *

C<<< "Can't import missing subroutine NAME" >>> -- the named subroutine is listed in
C<<< @EXPORT >>>, but is not defined in the ToolSet subclass

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

ToolSet requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

ToolSet requires at least Perl 5.6.  ToolSet subclasses will, of course, be
dependent on any modules they load.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Similar functionality is provided by the L<Toolkit> module, though that 
module requires defining the bundle via text files found within directories
in C<<< PERL5LIB >>> and uses source filtering to insert their contents as files
are compiled.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.  
Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at 
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=ToolSet>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to an
existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.
